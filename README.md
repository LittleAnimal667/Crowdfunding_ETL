# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this project we built and ETL pipeline using Pandas, Python to extract and clean data from Excel files, transform into CSV files, and upload into a SQL database using PostgreSQL. 

The SQL database was prepared first in an ERD with the tool available at #quickdatabasediagrams and uploaded to PostgreSQL as its final destination in the ETL. 

We prove that the SQL database works by requesting data from all the tables in Postgres using 4 SELECT statements.
